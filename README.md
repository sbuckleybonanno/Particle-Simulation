# Particle-Simulation
An experiment with particles, colors, and geometry, which you can try out [**here**](https://sbuckleybonanno.github.io/Particle-Simulation/). 

Inspired by [Hakim El Hattab](http://hakim.se/)'s [Bacterium Experiment](http://lab.hakim.se/bacterium/01/), and made possible thanks to [this](https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi) implementation of [Fortune's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune%27s_algorithm).
